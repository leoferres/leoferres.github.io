<p>
<b>A Mother's Love</b>, attributed to a little-known Swedish painter Carl
Olof Petersen (1828â€“1881), was said to have been painted in 1867 after
he heard stories of a grieving mother who begged for her lost child's
return and instead embraced something monstrous. Petersen, remembered
in small circles for his dark style and interest in themes of
motherhood and the supernatural, supposedly captured this disturbing
vision in a work that shocked audiences of the time, with rumors of
fainting and even a curse before it disappeared into a private
collection. The painting shows an old woman in pale robes, eyes closed
in gentle devotion, holding a demonic figure with glowing red eyes and
sharp teeth, its dark, clawed body a harsh contrast to her calm but
determined expression.
</p>

<p>
Except it isn't. It's AI generated (the painting, not the story). The
image first surfaced on Instagram (though the original post has since
been removed) under the title "A Mother's Love", credited to Carl Olof
Petersen. It spread quickly, gaining traction before disappearing,
only to reappear in new uploads; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C0-u0sMRWjg/?igsh=NjB3bjF4OWJmdmV2">one of which</a> has already reached over
16K likes. Commenters marveled at what they thought was a forgotten
masterpiece, speculating on its symbolism and supposed place in art
history, though some have since noted it was AI-made. In fact, the
"painting" was created with AI image generation tools, the false
backstory crafted to make it seem real. The conversation then moved to
Reddit, where users began to question its origins (see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatIsThisPainting/comments/1g7ug5m/help_identify_this_painting_is_it_really_a">this thread</a>),
and soon after the truth came out.
</p>

<p>
But to me, it felt not only real, it also moved me deeply because of
my own experience: I could relate to the mother's feelings. And I know
I'm not the only one. On Reddit, in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatIsThisPainting/comments/1g7ug5m/help_identify_this_painting_is_it_really_a/">r/WhatIsThisPainting</a>, one user
wrote, "It looks real to me, too," echoing the certainty many
expressed when first seeing the image. The same response appeared on
Instagram, where the reposted version and other shares drew comments
about the powerful emotions it stirred. One caption read, "AI can
generate art&#x2026; it depicts the all-encompassing nature of a mother's
love and the intense connection I felt." Taken together, these
reactions show how strongly people connect to the image, even after
learning it isn't a "real" painting.
</p>

<p>
What does this mean for art? To me, it shows that what matters most is
not who made it or what tools were used, but its message and how it
makes us feel. An image created by AI can still hit just as hard as a
painting on canvas, because art is really about the meaning we take
from it (not the medium used to express it). This one touched me in a
very personal way, to the point of strong emotion. If something moves
us, whether joy, sadness, or wonder, then it works as art. That means
AI isn't just copying art; it's stepping into the same space where art
has always lived: in the feelings and reactions it brings out in us.
</p>

<p>
But there's one more thing. I can't paint, and I know I never will. To
learn oil painting at even a basic level would take me years, maybe a
lifetime, and even then there's no promise that I could ever reach the
skill needed to show what I truly mean. That gap, the distance between
what I feel inside and what my hands could put on a canvas, has always
been impossible to cross. Yet with AI, I can create something that
gets closer to the picture in my head. It gives me a way to share
emotions and ideas that would otherwise stay locked away, unexpressed.
</p>

<div style="margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom:0.5em; margin-left: 3em;">
    <a href="../img/FathersLove.png"><img src="../img/FathersLove.png"
    alt="A Father's Love"
    style="width:400px; height:auto; margin-right:5px; margin:0.5em; float: right;"></a>
</div>

<p>
I've lived through what almost every father goes through with their
children: the tension between love and discipline, the struggle to
guide while also letting go, the challenge of sharing hard-won
experience. So I began to wonder: what would a "father's love" look
like if it were a painting? I asked an AI to create one in a similar
style as "A Mother's Love". And here it is: "<b>A Father's Love</b>":
</p>

<p>
I loved it, more than I can really explain. What struck me was the
strength and the rough violence in the picture. The father looks like
he's been stabbed, maybe dying, yet he's embracing the child just like
the mother was. The "child" is holding on to him as well, almost as if
something important has been understood in that moment. Being a father
often has that mix of toughness and care. There's the need to protect,
even if it costs you, and the need to be firm, even if it causes
pain. Fathers can show love through hard lessons, through conflict,
and sometimes even through anger. That edge of violence, whether in
struggle, discipline, or sacrifice, can still carry a kind of love
inside it.
</p>

<p>
Even if I'm the only one who feels this, that's okay. What amazes me
is that I was able to express something in a "painting" that I never
could have made on my own. And if one day there's a machine that can
take this image and translate it into oil on canvas, with all the
richness and weight that medium deserves, I would be glad.
</p>

<p>
There's a lot more I could say, but I'll end with what matters most to
me: painting, like language, music, or any art, is only a tool for
sharing ideas. If you don't have an idea, the tool won't help you;
you'll still have nothing to say. But AI has given me a way to express
something I wanted to show without words, without needing years of
training in the medium. We've entered, in a very real sense, the era
of ideas. I'm still the one responsible for the message, for what it
means. Tools like language or painting are now cheap. What counts,
more than ever, are the ideas themselves.
